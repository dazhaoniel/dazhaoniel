I'm Daniel and I work at Square as a Software Engineer. Previously I worked at Weebly (acquired by Square) doing backend development, and prior to my startup life, I developed and maintained news alerts and APIs for The Wall Street Journal. On weekends, I like working out, volunteering, running, movies, eating out and coding personal projects. Before New York City, I lived in Upstate New York and Japan. I was born and raised in China.
